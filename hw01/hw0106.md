- The sizeof result for these new types.
- What will happen if you assign a value to an integer which is over the given size?
- Is it possible to do arithmetic operations between two operands with different bits?
- Is it possible to do arithmetic operations between \_BitInt(N) and unsigned \_BitInt(N)?
  - If yes, the result is \_BitInt(N) or unsigned \_BitInt(N)?
- What will happen if N is greater than BITINT_MAXWIDTH?
