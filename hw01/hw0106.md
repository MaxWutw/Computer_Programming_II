- The sizeof result for these new types.
- What will happen if you assign a value to an integer which is over the given size?
  Overflow occurs when a value exceeds the allowable range of a given data type. For example,
  (\_BitInt(3))7 + (\_BitInt(3))2 overflows, and the result is undefined as with other signed
  integer types. To avoid the overflow, the operation type can be widened to 4 bits by casting one of the
  operands to \_BitInt(4). As with other unsigned integer types, overflow of an unsigned \_BitInt is welldefined and the value wraps around with twos complement semantics.
- Is it possible to do arithmetic operations between two operands with different bits?
  Yes, it is possible to do arithmetic operations between two operands with different bits. Adding a \_BitInt(22) with a \_BitInt(4) will produce a result with \_BitInt(22), it adjusts to the larger one in the operation.
- Is it possible to do arithmetic operations between \_BitInt(N) and unsigned \_BitInt(N)?
  - If yes, the result is \_BitInt(N) or unsigned \_BitInt(N)?
- What will happen if N is greater than BITINT_MAXWIDTH?

## note

GCC13 -std=gnu2x doesn't even support that syntax yet, but current nightly GCC14 trunk does support it with -std=gnu23 (Godbolt)
